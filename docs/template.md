# Timeline templates

A timeline template is used to represent specific regulations of a programme in the PGR system. Whenever a student enrols, they will usually be assigned to a specific version of regulations, requiring them to complete [[PGR milestones]] at set deadline within the PGR journey. A timeline template is the representation of these deadlines and allows to roll out all compulsory milestones for a student's programme automatically. 

A few __important notes and disclaimers__ on this process:

* Once the milestones have been rolled out they can only manually be amended (or deleted), so extra care should be taken in this step to avoid extra work
* If the student interrupts, and the interruption is one that according to regulations changes their deadlines for milestone submissions, all milestones following the interruption can be "pushed" by a given number of days (to be indicated upon creating an interruption)
* Timeline templates are a convenience function for admins only. The system will simply instantiate the milestones defined in a template to make an admin's work easier. However, if the template is not correct, the entire student's journey will be incorrect. 

_It is hence essential that admin check the correctness of an entire student's timeline after they have enrolled!_
