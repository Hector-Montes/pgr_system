# Notifications

Notifications within the PGR system are by email only. The emails are autogenerated by the system upon 
* submission of documentation to [PGR milestones](milestone)
* approval or rejection of [PGR milestones](milestone)
* reminder of upcoming or due [PGR milestones](milestone)

The recipients of notifications are determined by the respective [user roles](roles).
