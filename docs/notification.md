# Notifications

Notifications within the PGR system are by email only. The emails are autogenerated by the system upon 
* submission of documentation to [[PGR milestones]]
* approval or rejection of [[PGR milestones]]
* reminder of upcoming or due [[PGR milestones]]

The recipients of notifications are determined by the respective [[user roles]].
