# Use Cases: Interruptions

Students can interrupt their studies. There are two types of interruptions:
1. *interruptive*: These interruptions cause all subsequent milestones to be rescheduled by the number of working days interrupted for. The system calculates the number of working days automatically based on official government information about working days when entering an interruption and moves the corresponding milestones by said number of working days. The number of days the milestones should be moved can also be overwritten manually, if needed. It is advised that the student's timeline is checked after entering an interruption and milestones rescheduled if and when needed, according to the current set of regulations. 
2. *non-interruptiove*: These are interuptions that are logged in the system, but have no impact on the student's timeline and due dates.

The different types of interruptions are set up according to the PGR regulations. Interruptions are also shown on the student's timeline.
