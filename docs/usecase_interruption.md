# Use Cases: Interruptions

Students can interrupt their studies. There are two types of interruptions:
1. *interruptive*: These interruptions cause all subsequent milestones to be rescheduled by the number of working days interrupted for. The system calculates the number of working days automatically when entering an interruption and moves the corresponding milestones (there is currently a [bug in rescheduling of milestones](https://github.com/LCAS/pgr_system/issues/49), though)
2. *non-interruptiove*: These are interuptions that are logged in the system, but have no impact on the student's timeline and due dates.

The different types of interruptions are set up according to the PGR regulations. Interruptions are also shown on the student's timeline.
