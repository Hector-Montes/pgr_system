# The Post-Graduate (Research) Management System (PGR System)

_The PGR system has been developed by [Peter Lightbody](https://github.com/pet1330) and [Marc Hanheide](https://github.com/marc-hanheide) based on a requirement analysis with the [College of Science at the University of Lincoln](https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/collegeofscience/) to support the formal processes of studying towards a PGR degree._

## Core Features

The system is a self-hosted solution providing an easy to use online browser-based management interface for _PGR student_, their _supervisors_, and the respective _administrators_ that are involved in the PGR procedures. It is currently hosted on University of Lincoln servers. A brief summary of the main features:

* SAML2 login via an institution's single-sign-on (SSO) page (e.g. at the University of Lincoln). Any student or member of staff can authenticate and gain access to the data base in principle, however, different [user roles](roles) restrict access as appropriate
* **management of student records** (including interruptions, programmes enrolled on, status, etc), supervisors, and management of compulsory and optional milestones forming part of a PGR journey
* support for a simple **[workflow](workflow)** of submitting and approving documentation required for [PGR milestones](milestone), as detailed in [PGR regulations](http://secretariat.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/university-regulations/)
* **Email [notifications](notification) system** informing about workflow events (submission and approvals of documentation), and reminding of upcoming milestones
* **Flexible [reporting](reporting)** (versatile filtering and querying) and export to Excel, PDF, as well as direct printing.
