The general workflow for [PGR milestones](milestone) is as follows:

For every compulsory student milestone, the following workflow will take place (in this order):

1. Student and Supervisors are notified by email `N` days prior to the due date of a milestone (`N` is configured in the `milestone type`).
1. Admins and Supervisors will see the student's milestone being listed among the "upcoming" milestones.
1. Student and Supervisor are notified by email on the due date of a milestone.
1. Admins and Supervisors will see the student's milestone being listed among the "overdue" milestones.
1. Student submits a PDF to the respective milestone online (obviously, they can and should do this _before_ it is overdue, in which case no overdue reminder is sent).
1. Admins, Supervisors, and the student themselves receive a confirmation email about the submission
1. Admins prepare the submission for consideration by the respective school or college panel. 
1. _Optional:_ If amendments are required (this could also be desk rejects identified by the admins themselves, e.g. missing information on forms), the milestone is rejected (with an explanation), upon which the student and supervisor are notified, and asked to amend and resubmit.
1. If the respective panel has concluded the milestone is to be approved, the admin approves the milestone in the system
1. Student and Supervisor are notified that the milestone is approved.
